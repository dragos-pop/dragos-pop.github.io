							<h1>Big Data Analysis with PySpark on OMRON connect data<br />
							</h1>
						</header>
						<h3>Apr 2021 ~ Internship at OMRON Healthcare Europe<br /><br /></h3>
						<p align="justify"><b>Length: </b> &nbsp; 1mo (at 1.0 FTE)<br /><br />

							<b>Programming languages: </b> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; - Python (PySpark, datetime, NumPy, collections,
							Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn)<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp; - SQL<br /><br />

							<b>Data: </b> &nbsp;Over 4 million blood pressure measurements registered via OMRON connect by
							approximately 35 000 users, including the systolic, diastolic, and pulse of each measurement,
							the time and date, the device used, as well as some extra features the device sensors detected, such
							as whether the cuff wrap was set properly or if it was too loose<br /><br />

							<b>Problem description: </b><br />
							Analyze data to gather insights about the OMRON devices, the OMRON connect app, and its
							users' blood pressure<br /><br />

							<b>Approach & Results: </b><br />
							After the data was read as a PySpark dataframe, it was preliminarily inspected by counting
                            the number of records, displaying the available features, their types, the number of missing
                            values, and the distinct values in the most important columns. Then, the blood pressure
                            measurements with values outside the realm of possibility were removed. Next, additional
                            variables were extracted from the device code using UDFs, namely the device type (upper arm
                            or wrist), cuff type (soft or hard), and its measuring technique (inflation or deflation).
                            Finally, a new variable suggesting the success of each measurement was generated based on
                            the signals registered by the sensors of each device. For example, if the device assessed
                            the cuff wrap as too loose, the measure was declared unsuccessful.<br /><br />

                            Following the feature engineering and data cleansing, the number of new users per month was
                            computed taking the first blood pressure measurement submitted by each user and aggregating
                            them per month. Accordingly, the trend was represented in the time plot below and one can
                            see that starting from 2018, there is a spike in new users at the beginning of the year,
                            perhaps due to New Year resolution or holiday presents. Additionally, the graph shows a
                            dramatic increase from May 2020 that is most likely associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

                            Another trend analyzed is the development of blood pressure over the months. For this, the
                            measurements were grouped per month and averaged using spark.sql. Accordingly, it was
                            discovered that during the hot season, the average blood pressure drops significantly in
                            comparison with the colder period, which aligns with previous specialized research.
                            <br />

                            <br /><br />
                            Similarly, the blood pressure was then represented over the days of the week and pictured,
                            as expected, a decrease in the last part of the week.
                            <br />

                            <br /><br />
                            Investigating the success rates of device types it was found that upper arm devices outperform
                            wrist devices by approximately 35%. In order to see what is provoking the errors, the data
                            from the sensors was further investigated. Subsequently, half the errors were attributed to
                            the position sensor of the wrist devices, leaving the company an important insight.<br /><br />

                            Lastly, the study addressed the users who changed their devices. More exactly, the number
                            of devices that are most often being replaced and the ones which are favorite to upgrade to
                            were counted.<br /><br />

                            Consequently, this analysis pointed out how the OMRON devices are performing and comparing
                            against each other, but also how the users are using the app and how their BP varies over
                            time. The large amount of data analyzed gives credibility to the insights and helps OMRON
                            Healthcare to make informed business decisions.
